# Kara
Miniature Ransomware For Experimentation


**Please Note**

This software is for experimentation purposes only. It is a miniature program that encrypts a given file in the command line argument and uses basic ciphers to do so.

Files marked as .kara are files that have been encrypted.

To use:

Python kara.py (filename)

Command and Control server must be run in an IDE as it is not a package war. Feel free to make it into one if you wish otherwise it must be run in an IDE with TomCat.
Also please make sure you have SQLite on your machine otherwise you will not be able to retrieve the keys to decrypt your files! (unless you debug it of course)
and please do not test this on an important file.
